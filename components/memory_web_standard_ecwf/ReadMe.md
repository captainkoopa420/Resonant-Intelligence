# Adaptive Ethical Cognitive Wave Function (ECWF) Core

This repository contains the implementation of the Adaptive Ethical Cognitive Wave Function (ECWF) Core, a network model designed to simulate the dynamic interplay of cognitive and ethical factors within a network of nodes. 

## Overview

The Adaptive ECWF Core model is built upon the following key concepts:

- **Cognitive Dimensions:** Represent the cognitive aspects of nodes in the network.
- **Ethical Dimensions:** Represent the ethical aspects of nodes in the network.
- **Facets:** Distinct components of the network, each with its own set of parameters.
- **Memory Web:** The underlying network structure where nodes connect and interact. It is a dynamic network represented as a graph, where:
    - **Nodes:** Represent entities with cognitive and ethical activation levels.
    - **Edges:** Represent connections between nodes with varying strengths.
    - **Activation Levels:** Reflect the intensity of cognitive and ethical states for each node.
    - **Connection Strengths:** Indicate the influence or flow of information between connected nodes.
- **ECWF Wave Function:** A mathematical function used to model the combined cognitive and ethical influence within the network.

## Functionality

The code provides the following functionality:

- **Network Initialization:** Creates a network with specified dimensions, facets, and nodes. It initializes the Memory Web with random connections and activation levels.
- **ECWF Calculation:** Computes the ECWF wave function based on cognitive and ethical inputs.
- **Network Update:** Dynamically updates the network state based on the ECWF wave function, adjusting node activations and connection strengths within the Memory Web.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization capabilities for the ECWF wave function (3D plot) and the Memory Web (node activations, connection strengths).

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Make sure you have the required libraries installed: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `networkx`. You can install them using pip:

2. **Running the Simulation:** Execute the `memory_web_standard.py` script to run the simulation. You can adjust parameters such as the number of cognitive/ethical dimensions, facets, nodes, and simulation steps within the script.

3. **Visualization:** The simulation will generate visualizations of the ECWF wave function and the evolving Memory Web structure.
