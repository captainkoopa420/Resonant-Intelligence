# ECWF + Memory Web — A Proof of Concept

**Repository:** Resonant-Intelligence/P.O.C  
**File:** `ECWF + Memory Web.py`

---

## Overview

This script represents a **proof of concept** (PoC) for a novel approach to AI that merges:

1. **Wave-Based Cognition** — Treating intelligence as a *superposition* of wave facets (amplitude, phase, feedback).  
2. **Ethical Integration** — Extending the wavefunction to incorporate *ethical states* directly, rather than applying them as external constraints.  
3. **Memory Web** — A NetworkX-driven structure that tracks evolving node/edge activations, giving interpretability to how “ethical” and “cognitive” facets propagate over time.

The code unifies these ideas into a functional system that can **classify** synthetic data, update internal wavefunction parameters adaptively, and maintain a dynamic “memory web” for interpretability.

### What Is This Exactly?

- **ECWF (Ethical Cognitive Wave Function):**  
  A mathematically inspired model that treats cognition and ethics as interwoven wave phenomena. Each facet has amplitude and phase. Over time, these wave facets interact and adapt, producing emergent behavior.

- **Memory Web:**  
  A random graph whose node activations are influenced by the wavefunction amplitude. It serves as a **visual interpretability layer**—showing how different “aspects” of the system light up over time.

- **Proof of Concept:**  
  Although the code demonstrates classification accuracy on toy data (~50–60%), it primarily establishes that:
  1. Wave-based cognition can be implemented end-to-end in Python.  
  2. Memory Webs can track internal state changes, offering a unique lens on system dynamics.

## Key Features

1. **Adaptive Rate & Feedback:**  
   - The wavefunction parameters (`k, m, ω, φ`) are randomly perturbed each iteration, guided by an adaptive rate.  
   - A *feedback factor* modifies the wave amplitude via a `tanh` coupling term, simulating the interplay of cognition and ethics.

2. **Two Separate Memories**  
   - **Classification Memory**: Stores wavefunction outputs from single-sample classification.  
   - **Visualization Memory**: (Optional) used for large 2D wavefunction plots.  
   This separation prevents shape mismatches and keeps the wavefunction “memory effect” coherent within each context.

3. **3D Wavefunction Plot**  
   - Renders the magnitude of the ECWF (`|Ψ|`) over a 2D grid of “cognitive” vs. “ethical” input values.

4. **Memory Web Visualization**  
   - A NetworkX graph where node color/size reflect “cognitive” and “ethical” activations, and edges have adaptive “strength.”  
   - Provides a conceptual snapshot of the system’s current internal state.

5. **Scikit-Learn Integration**  
   - The `ECWFClassifier` is a scikit-learn–style **estimator**, compatible with cross-validation (`cross_val_score`) and standard ML pipelines.  
   - Demonstrates a potential path for **comparisons** to other classifiers and hyperparameter tuning.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies:**  
   - NumPy, Matplotlib, NetworkX, scikit-learn, Numba (optionally).  
   - Tested in a Jupyter or Colab environment.

2. **Running the Script:**  
   - Clone the repository and open `ECWF + Memory Web.py` in a Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Run the cells (or execute `python ECWF + Memory Web.py` if you adapt it to a .py script with an appropriate `if __name__ == "__main__":` block).

3. **Output:**  
   - **Cross-validation** accuracy is printed. (Don’t expect high accuracy on synthetic data—it’s a demonstration of feasibility.)  
   - **Wavefunction 3D plot** and **Memory Web** graph pop up.  
   - The code separates memory usage for classification vs. visualization to avoid shape conflicts.

## Roadmap

- **Refining Ethics:**  
  Integrate real ethical constraints or formal utility metrics so the wavefunction’s “ethical” dimension is more than a placeholder.

- **Scaling Up:**  
  Test on larger, more complex datasets or real-world scenarios.  
  See if wave-based synergy or memory web interpretability provides clear advantages over baseline ML.

- **Parameter Tuning:**  
  Explore different numbers of facets, adaptive rates, or memory-length settings to find emergent behaviors or performance gains.

- **Community Engagement:**  
  Share the code, invite feedback, replicate results. Possibly explore quantum computing or analog hardware that naturally fits a wave-based model.
