# Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)

## 5. Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)

## Purpose:

Represents the system’s computational threshold, marking the transition between:

- **Rigidity:** Deterministic, rule-based behavior (below Tg).
- **Emergence:** Adaptive, creative behavior (at Tg).

## Key Factors Influencing Tg:

1.  **Computational Complexity:** How much the system can process in real-time.
2.  **Entropy-Based Feedback:** The richness of feedback loops guiding the system’s learning and adaptation.
