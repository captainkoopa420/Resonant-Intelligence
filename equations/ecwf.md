# Ethical Cognitive Wave Function (ECWF)

## 2.2. Ethical Cognitive Wave Function (ECWF)
<p>
$$
Ψ_E(x, e, t) = Σ \left[ M_i(x, e, t) \cdot e^{iΘ_i(x, e, t)} \right]
$$
</p>

## Purpose:

Extends the Cognitive Wave Function to include ethical dimensions (e), enabling the system to model ethical reasoning dynamically.

## Components:

- **e:** Ethical state vector, introducing ethical considerations into the cognitive process.
- **Θ<sub>i</sub>(x, e, t):** Phase alignment of cognitive and ethical dimensions, reflecting their interaction over space and time.

## Function:

- Models how cognitive and ethical priorities interact, producing dynamic responses to complex scenarios.
