# Unified Wave System (With Boundary Coupling)

## 4. Unified Wave System (With Boundary Coupling)
<p>
$$
Ψ_U(x, e, t) = N^{-1} Σ_i \left[ M_i(x, e, t) \cdot \exp(iΘ_i(x, e, t)) \right]
$$
</p>

## Purpose:

Describes the unified state of cognition and ethics, incorporating boundary coupling to model interactions across dimensions.

## Boundary Coupling:
<p>
$$
B_i(x, e, t) = 1 + γ_i \cdot \tanh(\nabla_x \cdot \nabla_e) \cdot \exp(-λ|\nabla_x \times \nabla_e|^2)
$$
</p>

## Function:

- **Gradient-Based Dynamics:** Reflects interactions between cognitive (x) and ethical (e) states.
- **Coupling Parameters:**
    - **γ<sub>i</sub>:** Controls the intensity of coupling.
    - **λ:** Determines the decay of coupling strength across space.
